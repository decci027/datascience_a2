Each input feature (like x and y) forms a vector that gets multiplied by a weight matrix as it passes into the first hidden layer. This process continues layer by layer, with each neuron in a layer computing a dot product using the incoming values and their associated weights. The lines connecting the neurons in the visualization represent these weights, with blue lines indicating positive weights and orange lines indicating negative ones—their thickness representing the strength of the weight. Though the matrices aren't shown explicitly, every time values move from one layer to the next, matrix multiplication is happening behind the scenes to compute the activations for the following layer."
